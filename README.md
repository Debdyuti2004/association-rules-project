# 📊 Association Rules Project (Apriori Algorithm)

This project demonstrates the use of the **Apriori Algorithm** for **Association Rule Mining** to uncover hidden relationships between student study habits and academic performance.  
It applies frequent itemset mining and generates rules evaluated by **support, confidence, and lift**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of study habit dataset  
- One-hot encoding using **TransactionEncoder**  
- Frequent itemset mining using **Apriori**  
- Association rules generation with **support, confidence, and lift**  
- Sorting of rules to highlight the most interesting patterns  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Mlxtend**
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**
- **Data Mining (Apriori Algorithm)**
